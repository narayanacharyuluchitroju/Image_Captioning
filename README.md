Multi-modal Data Analysis for Image Captioning on Flickr Dataset
This project demonstrates image captioning using a deep learning approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). 
The task is to generate descriptive captions for images using the Flickr dataset.

Overview
The model is based on a multi-modal approach that integrates both visual data (images) and textual data (captions). The project pipeline includes:

Preprocessing the images and captions.
Extracting features from the images using a pre-trained CNN (ResNet).
Generating captions for the images using a sequence model (LSTM).
Evaluating the model using BLEU scores.
Visualizing the generated captions alongside the actual captions.
Dataset
The Flickr8k dataset is used for this project. It consists of 8,000 images, each associated with five different captions. The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from Flickr8k Dataset.

Dataset Structure:
Images: JPEG format files.
Captions: A text file containing image IDs and associated captions.
Model Architecture
Feature Extraction (CNN): A trained ResNet-50 model extracts visual features from each image. The CNN converts each image into a feature vector.

Caption Generation (LSTM):

The textual captions are tokenized, and the vocabulary is created.
An LSTM model is trained to generate a caption word by word, conditioned on the image features and previous words in the caption.
Loss Function: The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss to compare predicted and actual captions.

Optimization: The Adam optimizer is used to update the model parameters.

Training & Evaluation
The model is trained using paired image and caption data.
After training, the model is evaluated using the BLEU score, which compares the generated captions with the ground truth captions.
Prerequisites
To run the code, you need the following libraries:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow / Keras
Numpy
Matplotlib
nltk (for BLEU score evaluation)
Install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run

Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/narayanacharyuluchitroju/Image_Captioning.git
Download the Flickr dataset from here and place the images and captions in the appropriate directories.

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
jupyter notebook Multi_modal_data_analysis_on_flicker_dataset.ipynb
The notebook will guide you through:

Loading and preprocessing the data.
Extracting image features using the ResNet model.
Training the LSTM-based model to generate captions.
Evaluating the model using the BLEU score.
Results
The model generates captions for the images in the Flickr dataset and is evaluated using BLEU scores. Some examples of generated captions are displayed at the end of the notebook, comparing the predicted and actual captions.

Future Improvements
Incorporate attention mechanisms to improve the quality of generated captions.
Use more advanced pre-trained models such as Transformer-based models for better performance.
Explore using larger datasets like MS COCO for richer vocabulary and more complex sentence structures.
